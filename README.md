## 🧠 What It Does

**EcoPhysics** simplifies difficult scientific theories and encourages **active learning**.  
It guides users through **four educational modules**:

1. **Quantum Particles** – Explore the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.  
2. **Protons & Neutrons** – Understand nuclear physics and atomic structure.  
3. **Atoms** – Build and visualize atomic models interactively.  
4. **Greenhouse Gases** – Connect atomic behavior to real-world climate science.  

Each module combines **interactive simulations**, **AI tutoring**, and **quizzes** to help learners gain a deeper understanding of how physics applies to the world around them.
